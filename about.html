				&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, My name is Rakshak Bajracharya. I studied in Palpasa primary school to complete my elementary education. Then I studied at Future Stars High School to complete my middle and high school education. I passed my high school education with first division on the board examination. I then studied my +2 in MOLIHSS(Moonlight Higher Secondary School) which is in kumaripati with science as a major. After completing high school education, I am aiming for a bachelor in Computing in NAMI, Jorpati.<br><br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very open minded and I like to view things outside the box. I have always been interested in computers and the technology that uses them amazes me. I have always wanted to know this magic-like art in which you make something out of nothing. My experience in NAMI has opened my eyes to a bigger and better world. I have been learning many skills in NAMI that have broadened my horizons. I hope to learn more about web developing to see what can be achieved with it and maybe do something amazing with it. Besides computers, my hobbies include playing instruments such as guitars, drums, etc. I also like to play football, volleyball, etc with my friends to pass the time.
